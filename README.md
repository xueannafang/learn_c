# learn_c
 This is my playground to learn C;

 (Actually, I met C about 15 years ago.. to control a virtual robot, which didn't work perfectly and I was scared by lots of {;{;{;}}} before I've even learnt enough English words.. It's better now since I've got some Python knowledge! And I guess learning C is still very important as it can help to understand deeper in how computer works, and how other higher level programming language works. Most importantly, it helps to know the complexity of some basic operations we take for granted in Python, and therefore we can design the algorithm in a more efficient way in the future..)

 Ready for the new challenge!
