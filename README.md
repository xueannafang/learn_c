# learn_c

 This is my playground to learn C;

 I first met C about 15 years ago.. as a little project to control a virtual robot to walk through a map and do some simple operations. That didn't work perfectly and I was scared by lots of {;{;{;}}} before I've even known enough English words, nor basic programming thoughts.. (In the end, the younger version me recited 18 pages of codes, which is absolutely the wrong way of learning coding as I realised a few years later..)
 
 It's better now since I've got some Python knowledge! And I guess learning C is still very important as it can help to understand deeper in how computer works, and how other higher level languages work. Most importantly, it helps to know the complexity of some basic operations we take for granted in Python, and therefore we can design the algorithm in a more efficient way in the future..

 Some resources I found useful: W3Schools, CodeWars, Youtube - WilliamFiset, Youtube - CodeVault, ...

## Files and notes - the learning diary

I will not start with a ```Hello World!```, because string operation seems not very straightforward on day 0...

- To compile:

Go to terminal, type ```gcc filename.c -o filename```

It will get a ```.exe``` file under current working directory.

- [data_type](https://github.com/xueannafang/learn_c/blob/main/data_type.c)
Claim data type, convert data type..

- [simple_calc](https://github.com/xueannafang/learn_c/blob/main/simple_calc.c)
Calculate the area of a circle.. Now we can use C as a calculator.

- [if_elif](https://github.com/xueannafang/learn_c/blob/main/if_elif.c)
Branching in C.

- [switch_test](https://github.com/xueannafang/learn_c/blob/main/switch_test.c)
Don't want too many ```else if```?

- [fibonacci](https://github.com/xueannafang/learn_c/blob/main/fibonacci.c)
Write a simple for loop.

- [recursive](https://github.com/xueannafang/learn_c/blob/main/recursive.c)
Another way to write Fibo.

- [array_test](https://github.com/xueannafang/learn_c/blob/main/array_test.c)
Basic array operations.. (Very different from Python, string is an array in C.)

- [matrix_multi](https://github.com/xueannafang/learn_c/blob/main/matrix_multi.c)
Impressed by the complexity of matrix multiplication.

- [write_txt](https://github.com/xueannafang/learn_c/blob/main/write_txt.c)
Simple file operation with C. Pointer introduced.

- [read_csv](https://github.com/xueannafang/learn_c/blob/main/read_csv.c)
Handle more complicated situation, with text and delimiter. Struct introduced.

... A few more practice is available on CodeWars ...

Note added in the middle of learning:

Simply learning syntax and functions becomes not enough. Attention need to be paid on data structures..
