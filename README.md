# learn_c
 This is my playground to learn C;

 I learnt Python first.. but good to know more about the basics of computer, which I guess would help to know any other program languages better, too.

 (Actually, I met C about 15 years ago.. to control a virtual robot, which didn't work perfectly and I was scared by lots of {;{;{;}}} before I've even learnt enough English words.. It's better now since I've got some beginner level Python knowledge!)

 Ready for the new challenge!
